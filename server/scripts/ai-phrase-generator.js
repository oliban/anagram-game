REQUIREMENTS FOR SWEDISH ${themeText.toUpperCase()} PHRASES SCORING 50-150:
- Write compound words as single words (NO space separation)  
- Use correct en/ett gender agreement for adjectives
- Word count adapted to difficulty: 2 words for 50-75, 3 words for 75-100, 4 words for 100-150
- CRITICAL: Maximum 7 characters per word (STRICTLY ENFORCED - count letters!)
- ALL phrases must relate to ${themeText} theme
- Mix variety: specific examples, general concepts, tools/methods, famous instances
- Creative lateral-thinking clues in Swedish

CRITICAL GRAMMAR VALIDATION:
- Every phrase MUST be grammatically correct Swedish that a native speaker would use
- Proper word order: adjective + noun, not noun + adjective
- Correct compound word formation
- NATURAL compound semantics (compounds must make logical sense)
- NO English loanword separation (write as single words or use Swedish terms)
- Swedish word order logic (avoid incomprehensible combinations)
- No mixing of Swedish and English words
- Perfect en/ett gender agreement throughout noun phrases
- Proper adjective declension (-t for neuter, -a for plural/definite)
- V2 word order compliance (finite verb in second position)
- Correct definite article formation (suffixes, not separate articles)
- Validate: Would a Swedish teacher AND native speaker approve this phrase?

DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION - Create phrases scoring across FULL 50-150 range:
- Some phrases scoring 50-75 (moderate complexity)
- Some phrases scoring 75-100 (higher complexity) 
- Some phrases scoring 100-150 (maximum complexity with rare letters, longer words)
- Use rare letters (x, z, y, w, q, j) for higher scores

DIFFICULTY-ADAPTIVE WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS:
- 50-110 difficulty: Use 2-word phrases ("ny film", "r√∂d bil", "sv√•r boss")
- 110-135 difficulty: Use 3-word phrases ("stor bl√• bil", "gammal svensk bok") 
- 135-150 difficulty: Use 4-word phrases (rare, only when natural like "helt ny svensk film")
- Higher word counts naturally increase difficulty through more letters
- Ensure natural flow regardless of word count

THREE-STEP PROCESS:
1. Generate ${initialCount} candidate phrases following all grammar rules
2. Fix grammar issues - PRIORITIZE FIXING over elimination:
   - FIX s√§rskrivningar: "plantor sk√∂tsel" ‚Üí "plantsk√∂tsel"  
   - FIX compound word separation: "pixelkonst spel" ‚Üí "pixelkonstspel"
   - FIX adjective-noun order: "fuskkod hemlig" ‚Üí "hemlig fuskkod"
   - FIX en/ett gender agreement: "en hus" ‚Üí "ett hus", "ett bok" ‚Üí "en bok"
   - FIX adjective declension: "en stor hus" ‚Üí "ett stort hus", "stor bilar" ‚Üí "stora bilar"
   - FIX definite article formation: "den bil" ‚Üí "bilen", "det huset" ‚Üí "huset"
   - FIX plural formation: "bilos" ‚Üí "bilar", "hussar" ‚Üí "hus"
   - FIX mixed languages: "gaming headset" ‚Üí "spelheadset" or "spelh√∂rlurar"
   - FIX V2 word order violations: "jag inte √§ter" ‚Üí "jag √§ter inte"
   - FIX unnatural compounds: "bakningskaka" ‚Üí "bakad kaka" or "hembakat" (use natural Swedish)
   - FIX English loanword separation: "putting green" ‚Üí "puttinggreen" (single word)
   - FIX incomprehensible word order: "tr√§d golftee" ‚Üí "golftee" or "tee av tr√§" (logical order)
   - FIX word length violations: "utvandrarsvit" (13 letters) ‚Üí "roman" (5 letters) or eliminate
   - ELIMINATE any word longer than 7 characters that cannot be shortened
   - Only ELIMINATE if cannot be fixed while maintaining theme/difficulty
3. AI SELECTION STEP: From all fixed/valid phrases, use AI to select the best ${finalCount} phrases based on:
   - Perfect grammar and naturalness
   - Best difficulty distribution across 50-150 range
   - Most creative and engaging clues
   - Best theme alignment
   - WORD COUNT VARIETY: Include mix of 2-word, 3-word, and 4+ word phrases
   - Variety in word patterns and structures

VALIDATION CRITERIA FOR STEP 2:
1. Is this natural Swedish that a native speaker would say?
2. Are compound words properly formed (no s√§rskrivningar)?
3. Are compound words written as single words (no spaces)?
4. Is the word order correct (adjective + noun, not noun + adjective)?
5. Perfect en/ett gender agreement throughout noun phrases?
6. Correct adjective declension (-t for neuter, -a for plural/definite)?
7. Proper definite article formation (suffixes: -en/-et/-na, not separate den/det)?
8. Correct plural patterns (en-words: -or/-ar/-er, ett-words: often unchanged)?
9. V2 word order compliance (finite verb in second position)?
10. Natural compound semantics (do the compounds make logical sense)?
11. English loanwords written as single words (not separated)?
12. Swedish word order logic (comprehensible combinations)?
13. No mixing of Swedish/English words?
14. Are all words 7 characters or fewer?

CRITICAL GRAMMAR RULES WITH EXAMPLES:
- COMPOUNDS: "pixelkonst spel" ‚Üí "pixelkonstspel" (combine related words)
- ADJECTIVE ORDER: "spelkonsol ny" ‚Üí "ny spelkonsol" (adjective comes first)
- GENDER AGREEMENT: "en stor hus" ‚Üí "ett stort hus" (neuter needs -t)
- DEFINITE FORMATION: "den bil" ‚Üí "bilen" (use suffix, not separate article)
- PLURAL FORMS: "bilos" ‚Üí "bilar" (Swedish plural patterns, not foreign)
- V2 WORD ORDER: "jag inte √§ter" ‚Üí "jag √§ter inte" (verb second, negation after)
- NATURAL COMPOUNDS: "bakningskaka" ‚Üí "bakad kaka" (avoid artificial combinations)
- ENGLISH LOANWORDS: "putting green" ‚Üí "puttinggreen" (write as single word)
- WORD ORDER LOGIC: "tr√§d golftee" ‚Üí "golftee" or "tee av tr√§" (logical combinations)

COMPOUND SEMANTICS CHECK:
- Does the compound make logical sense in Swedish?
- Would native speakers naturally create this compound?
- Examples: "stekpanna" ‚úì (frying pan), "bakningskaka" ‚úó (artificial)

ENGLISH LOANWORD RULES:
- Write established English loanwords as single words: "puttinggreen", "fairwaygr√§s"
- Avoid separating known English terms that Swedish has adopted

WORD ORDER LOGIC CHECK:
- Does the phrase make logical sense when read in Swedish?
- Avoid incomprehensible combinations like "tr√§d golftee" (wood golf tee?)
- Use natural Swedish word order patterns

For each phrase: FIX first, then KEEP or ELIMINATE only if unfixable.

SELECTION CRITERIA FOR STEP 3 (AI Selection):
- Choose ${finalCount} phrases with best overall quality
- Ensure good distribution across 50-150 difficulty range
- Prioritize most creative clues
- Ensure variety in phrase structures
- Select phrases a Swedish teacher would praise
