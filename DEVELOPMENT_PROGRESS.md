# Anagram Game Development Progress

## Project Overview
iOS "Anagram Game" for iPhone and Apple Watch with realistic physics. Tiles behave like real objects in a 3D bookshelf environment with tile rack. Players can flick tiles around, use device tilt to make tiles fall, and interact with a physically accurate world.

## Development Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [x] **Step 1: Project Setup** (30 mins)
  - Create new Xcode project with iOS + watchOS targets
  - Configure project settings (minimum iOS version, team, bundle ID)
  - Set up folder structure: Models/, Views/, Resources/
  - Add anagrams.txt to Resources with 5 sample sentences
  - Test project builds on simulator

- [x] **Step 2: Data Layer** (45 mins)
  - Create `GameModel.swift` with ObservableObject protocol
  - Implement text file loading from app bundle
  - Add sentence parsing (split by newlines, filter empty)
  - Create random sentence selection logic
  - Add letter scrambling algorithm (Fisher-Yates shuffle)
  - Unit tests for core data functions

- [ ] **Step 3: Core Game Logic** (60 mins)
  - Define game state enum (playing, completed, etc.)
  - Implement word validation logic (check if tiles form correct words)
  - Add game completion detection
  - Create reset/new game functionality
  - Add progress tracking (words completed count)
  - Handle edge cases (empty sentences, invalid characters)

### Phase 2: Physics Engine Setup
- [ ] **Step 4: SpriteKit Integration** (120 mins)
  - Set up SpriteKit scene within SwiftUI view
  - Create physics world with gravity and collision detection
  - Design bookshelf environment with tile rack and floor
  - Implement realistic tile physics bodies
  - Add CoreMotion integration for device tilt detection
  - Test basic physics interactions (flicking, falling)

- [ ] **Step 5: Physics-Based Tile System** (90 mins)
  - Create physics-enabled tile sprites with realistic properties
  - Implement tile flicking with momentum and friction
  - Add tile-to-tile collision detection
  - Create tile rack snap zones with physics constraints
  - Add visual feedback for tile interactions
  - Handle tile state in physics world (active, racked, completed)

- [ ] **Step 6: 3D Environment Design** (120 mins)
  - Create detailed bookshelf background with depth
  - Design tile rack with realistic proportions
  - Add floor area for fallen tiles
  - Implement lighting and shadows for 3D effect
  - Create environmental boundaries and collision shapes
  - Add visual polish (wood textures, realistic materials)

- [ ] **Step 7: Game Mechanics Integration** (90 mins)
  - Connect physics tiles to game model
  - Implement word formation detection in physics space
  - Add physics-based validation for correct word placement
  - Create particle effects for success celebrations
  - Add haptic feedback for tile interactions
  - Handle game completion with physics animations

### Phase 3: Polish & Extensions
- [ ] **Step 8: Device Motion & Advanced Physics** (90 mins)
  - Fine-tune CoreMotion sensitivity for natural tilt response
  - Add realistic physics constraints (tile weight, friction)
  - Implement advanced interactions (tile stacking, sliding)
  - Add sound effects synchronized with physics events
  - Optimize physics performance for smooth gameplay

- [ ] **Step 9: Apple Watch Version** (60 mins)
  - Create simplified physics version for Watch
  - Adapt controls for small screen (tap-based physics)
  - Share core GameModel while adapting physics complexity
  - Test Watch connectivity and performance

- [ ] **Step 10: Polish & Testing** (60 mins)
  - Add accessibility support for physics interactions
  - Test on different iPhone sizes and orientations
  - Optimize physics performance across devices
  - Add app icons and launch screen
  - Final testing with realistic usage patterns

## Current Status
**Started:** July 5, 2025
**Current Step:** Planning physics-based architecture

## Notes
