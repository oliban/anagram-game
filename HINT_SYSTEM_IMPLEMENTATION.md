# Hint System Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented a complete hint system for the Anagram Game that helps players by lighting up shelves to indicate where words should be placed.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Hint Button UI ✅
- Added green "Hint" button in the top-right VStack
- Positioned with other debug controls for easy access
- Styled consistently with existing UI elements

### 2. Shelf Identification System ✅
- Added `shelves` array to track individual shelf nodes
- Each shelf assigned a unique name identifier (`shelf_0`, `shelf_1`, etc.)
- Proper cleanup and initialization in shelf creation

### 3. Core Hint Functionality ✅
- `triggerHint()` function analyzes current target phrase
- Lights up the same number of shelves as there are words in the target
- Intelligent mapping: number of words → number of shelves to light

### 4. Enhanced Visual Shelf Lighting Effects ✅
- **Subtle color-coded hint system**:
  - **Warm cream**: First word placement
  - **Soft mint green**: Second word placement  
  - **Light sky blue**: Third word placement
  - **Lavender**: Fourth word placement
- **Whole shelf coverage**: Glow encompasses entire shelf including 3D depth
- **Gentle breathing animation**: Smooth fade in/out over 2-second cycles
- **Multi-layer effect**: Main glow with subtle shadow for depth
- **Low z-position**: Appears just above shelf without overwhelming other elements

### 5. Smart Hint Logic ✅
- Calculates word count from `gameModel.getExpectedWords()`
- Gracefully handles cases where phrase has more words than available shelves
- **Hints expire when new game starts** (automatic cleanup)
- No cooldowns or limitations during active game

### 6. Game State Integration ✅
- `clearAllHints()` function removes all glow effects
- Automatically called when `resetGame()` is triggered
- Clean state transitions between games

## Implementation Details

### Code Changes
1. **PhysicsGameView.swift**: Added hint button UI
2. **PhysicsGameScene**: 
   - Added `shelves` array property
   - Modified shelf creation to track shelves
   - Implemented `triggerHint()` function
   - Implemented `lightUpShelf()` with visual effects

### Example Usage
- Player has phrase "I love you" (3 words)
- Clicking "Hint" lights up 3 shelves:
  - Top shelf: Yellow glow (for "I")
  - Second shelf: Green glow (for "love") 
  - Third shelf: Blue glow (for "you")

### Technical Features
- **Glow Effects**: Uses SKShapeNode with rounded rectangles
- **Color System**: Systematic color coding for word positions
- **Animation**: Continuous pulsing for attention
- **Cleanup**: Removes existing hints before adding new ones
- **Performance**: Lightweight implementation with minimal overhead

## User Experience
- **No Limitations**: Can use hint as many times as needed
- **Persistent**: Hints stay visible for entire game session
- **Clear Visual Feedback**: Color-coded system shows word order
- **Intuitive**: Simple single-tap activation

## Testing Status
✅ Builds successfully without compilation errors  
✅ All todo items completed  
✅ Ready for user testing

## Future Enhancements (Optional)
- Different hint animations (breathing, sparkle effects)
- Hint intensity levels (subtle vs prominent)
- Custom hint colors based on user preference
- Sound effects for hint activation
