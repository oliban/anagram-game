## 🏠 Raspberry Pi Infrastructure Analysis

### Hardware Specifications
**Raspberry Pi 4 Model B (4GB):**
- CPU: Quad-core ARM Cortex-A72 @ 1.5GHz
- RAM: 4GB LPDDR4-3200
- Storage: 64GB microSD + external SSD (optional)
- Network: Gigabit Ethernet + 802.11ac WiFi
- Power: ~5W under load

### Operating Costs
**Electricity Usage:**
```
Power Consumption Analysis:
Idle: 2.7W
Under Load: 4.4W  
Average (development): ~3.5W

Cost Calculation:
3.5W × 24h × 30 days = 2.52 kWh/month
At $0.20/kWh = $0.50/month electricity
```

**Internet Bandwidth:**
- No additional cost (uses existing home internet)
- Upload bandwidth sufficient for development (tested: 2-5 users)
- Download bandwidth irrelevant for server hosting

### Reliability Considerations
**Uptime Analysis:**
- Pi uptime: 99.5% (typical home setup with UPS)
- Home internet uptime: 99.8% (typical residential ISP)
- Combined availability: ~99.3%

**Vs AWS uptime: 99.9%**

## 💡 Strategic Cost Management

### Development Economics
```
Break-even Analysis:
Pi setup saves $500-700/year vs AWS
Investment in Pi setup: ~4 hours @ $50/hour = $200 value
Payback period: 1-2 months

ROI after 1 year: 300-400%
```

### Scale Triggers
**When to migrate from Pi to AWS:**
1. **Concurrent users** > 20-30 consistently
2. **API requests** > 10,000/day
3. **Uptime requirements** > 99.5%
4. **Global user base** (latency concerns)
5. **Team size** > 3 developers

### Hybrid Approach
**Pi for Development + AWS for Production:**
- Use Pi for all development and testing
- Deploy to AWS only for production releases
- Best of both worlds: low cost development + reliable production
