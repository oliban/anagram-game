# Phrase Generation Guide

## Complete Workflow for AI-Generated Phrases

### Working Directory Context
**CRITICAL**: Commands must be run from specific directories:
- **Generation script**: Run from PROJECT ROOT - `cd server && node scripts/phrase-generator.js`
- **Import script**: Run from PROJECT ROOT - `node server/scripts/phrase-importer.js` 
- **Deployment scripts**: Run from PROJECT ROOT
- **Docker commands**: Run from PROJECT ROOT
- **Database files**: Located in `server/data/` directory

**üö® PATH ERRORS**: If you get "Cannot find module" errors, you're in the wrong directory!

### Quick Commands

#### Local Generation and Import
```bash
# COMPLETE WORKFLOW FOR CLAUDE (from project root):
cd server && node scripts/phrase-generator.js --range 0-100 --count 10 --language sv --theme computing  # Generate 10 Swedish computing phrases
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: PRESENT GENERATED PHRASES TO USER IN TABLE FORMAT
# ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: WAIT FOR EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL BEFORE IMPORTING
# ONLY AFTER USER APPROVAL (run from PROJECT ROOT):
node server/scripts/phrase-importer.js --input server/data/phrases-sv-*.json --import  # Import to local database
```

#### Staging Import (3-step process)
```bash
# 1. Copy generated file to staging server:
scp server/data/phrases-*.json pi@192.168.1.222:~/anagram-game/server/data/

# 2. Import on staging server:
ssh pi@192.168.1.222 "cd ~/anagram-game/server && node scripts/phrase-importer.js --input data/phrases-*.json --import"
```

### Critical Path Corrections
- **Phrase generation**: `cd server && node scripts/phrase-generator.js` (must cd to server directory first)
- **Phrase import**: `cd server && node scripts/phrase-importer.js` (must cd to server first)  
- **Staging deploy**: `./scripts/deploy-staging.sh` (from project root)
- **Working directory matters** - commands fail if run from wrong directory!
- **üö® MANDATORY**: Always present phrases to user in table format and get approval before importing

## 8-Step Process Flow (WITH MANDATORY USER APPROVAL)

### 1. Entry Point
`phrase-generator.js` ‚Üí `ai-phrase-generator.js`

### 2. Overgeneration Strategy
- **Request 10** ‚Üí **Generate 40 candidates** (4x quality buffer)
- Provides selection flexibility
- Ensures quality through abundance

### 3. AI Processing
- **Generate** initial phrases
- **Fix Swedish grammar** using language rules
- **Select best 10** WITH PROPER DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION

### 4. Difficulty Scoring
- Each phrase scored using `shared/difficulty-algorithm`
- Consistent scoring across iOS and server
- Algorithm considers word complexity, length, patterns

### 5. Validation Rules
- **Word length**: ‚â§7 characters per word
- **Word count**: 2-4 words per phrase
- **Theme relevance**: Must match requested theme
- **Language rules**: Swedish grammar validation

### 6. Output Format
- Structured JSON with metadata
- Difficulty scores included
- Theme and language information
- Creation timestamps

### 7. üö® MANDATORY USER REVIEW (CRITICAL STEP - NEVER SKIP!)
- **üî¥ ALWAYS EXTRACT AND SHOW TABLE** from import results to user
- **üî¥ NEVER IMPORT** without showing user the complete table first
- **üî¥ PRESENT TABLE** showing: Phrase | Clue | Score | Language | Import Status | Reason
- **üî¥ WAIT FOR USER APPROVAL** after showing the table
- **üî¥ USER MUST SEE** every phrase, clue, score, and import status before approval
- **üî¥ EXTRACT TABLE FROM OUTPUT** - don't let it get buried in verbose logs
- **üî¥ STOP AND PRESENT TABLE** - even if import already ran, extract and show the table!

### 8. Import Process (ONLY AFTER USER APPROVAL)
- Database import with staging server support
- **ONLY after user explicitly approves the presented phrases table**
- Direct database access (no HTTP API)
- **üö® DO NOT PROCEED** without user approval from step 7

## üéØ DIFFICULTY DISTRIBUTION REQUIREMENTS

### Core Principle
For ANY requested range (e.g., 30-100), phrases MUST be distributed across the FULL range:

### Distribution Algorithm
1. **Divide range into equal buckets** (e.g., 30-100 = 7 buckets of ~10 points each)
2. **Select 1-2 phrases from EACH bucket** to ensure spread
3. **NEVER cluster >50% of phrases** in one narrow band

### Example: 30-100 range with 10 phrases
- **30-39**: 1-2 phrases
- **40-49**: 1-2 phrases  
- **50-59**: 1-2 phrases
- **60-69**: 1-2 phrases
- **70-79**: 1-2 phrases
- **80-89**: 1-2 phrases
- **90-100**: 0-1 phrases

### What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå **BAD**: 8 phrases in 40-49, 1 in 30-39, 1 in 50-59 (80% clustering)
- ‚úÖ **GOOD**: Even distribution across the requested range

## üéØ SELECTION ALGORITHM REQUIREMENTS

When selecting final phrases from 40 candidates, use intelligent distribution:

### 6-Step Selection Process
1. **Calculate target buckets** based on requested range
2. **Score each candidate phrase** for difficulty using difficulty-algorithm
3. **Sort candidates into difficulty buckets**
4. **Select 1-2 best phrases from each bucket** (quality + theme + variety)
5. **Ensure no bucket is empty** and no bucket has >30% of total phrases
6. **Prioritize**: grammar > theme alignment > difficulty spread > clue creativity

## Current Implementation

### Swedish Language Focus
- **Current implementation**: Hardcoded Swedish phrases in `ai-phrase-generator.js`
- **When asked to generate**: Follow 3-step process documented in code comments
- **Grammar validation**: 3-step AI process for Swedish language rules

### 3-Step AI Process
1. **Generate**: Create initial phrase candidates
2. **Fix**: Apply Swedish grammar rules and corrections (see critical rules below)
3. **Select**: Choose best phrases with proper difficulty distribution

### üö® CRITICAL SWEDISH GRAMMAR RULES (MANDATORY APPLICATION)

#### Compound Words (S√§rskrivning Prevention)
**S√ÑRSKRIVNING** = incorrectly separating compound words with spaces

**RULE: Swedish compound words MUST be written as single words - NO SPACES allowed**

When two related words should form a compound, they must be joined without spaces. Swedish speakers naturally create compounds for related concepts (kitchen tools, food combinations, cooking processes). 

Examples: "ris sk√•l" ‚Üí "rissk√•l", "gr√§dde s√•s" ‚Üí "gr√§dds√•s", "kock kniv" ‚Üí "kockkniv"

#### Grammar Rules to ALWAYS Apply:
1. **No s√§rskrivning**: Compound words = single words (no spaces)
2. **Double consonant reduction**: "soppa gryta" ‚Üí "soppgryta" (remove duplicate consonant)
3. **Connecting consonants**: Add 's' when needed: "vitl√∂k press" ‚Üí "vitl√∂kspress"
4. **Natural compounds**: Only create compounds that Swedish speakers would naturally use
5. **Word length check**: Each word ‚â§7 characters after compound formation

#### Validation Checklist for EVERY Swedish Phrase:
- [ ] No spaces in compound words (s√§rskrivning check)
- [ ] Natural Swedish compound formation
- [ ] Correct en/ett gender agreement
- [ ] Proper adjective declension
- [ ] Each word ‚â§7 characters
- [ ] Would a native speaker approve this phrase?

## üö® CRITICAL: User Approval Process (MANDATORY STEP)

### üî¥ NEVER IMPORT WITHOUT APPROVAL
- **üî¥ ALWAYS PRESENT** generated phrases in a review table
- **üî¥ WAIT FOR EXPLICIT USER APPROVAL** before running import commands
- **üî¥ USER MUST APPROVE**: phrases, clues, difficulty scores, and theme relevance
- **üî¥ USER WILL CHECK**: difficulty distribution quality (no bad clustering)
- **üî¥ CLAUDE MUST STOP** and wait for user response before proceeding with import

### Review Table Format (MANDATORY TO SHOW USER)
**üî¥ ALWAYS EXTRACT THIS TABLE FROM IMPORT OUTPUT AND PRESENT TO USER:**

| Phrase | Clue | Score | Language | Imported | Reason |
|--------|------|-------|----------|----------|---------|
| [phrase] | [clue] | [score] | [lang] | ‚úÖ/‚ùå | [reason] |

**üî¥ CRITICAL**: Extract this table from verbose output and present clearly to user
**üî¥ NEVER**: Let the table get buried in logs - always highlight it separately

## üîí SECURITY UPDATE: Admin API Endpoints Removed

### What Changed
- **All admin batch import endpoints removed** (security update)
- **Replaced with secure direct database script access**
- **Benefits**: No network exposure, better performance, reduced attack surface

### New Secure Import Method
```bash
# Direct database access only (no HTTP API)
node scripts/phrase-importer.js --input file.json --import
```

### Security Benefits
- **No network exposure** for admin operations
- **Better performance** with direct database access
- **Reduced attack surface** - no HTTP endpoints to exploit
- **Cleaner architecture** - fewer services to secure

## Phrase Generation Scripts

### Main Generation Script
```bash
# From project root, cd to server directory first:
cd server && node scripts/phrase-generator.js --range difficulty-range --count count --language language --theme theme
```

### Parameters
- **difficulty-range**: e.g., "1-100", "30-70" 
- **count**: number of phrases to generate
- **language**: "sv" for Swedish, "en" for English
- **theme**: topic category (cooking, computing, nature, etc.)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WORKFLOW REMINDER
```bash
# 1. Generate phrases (from project root)
cd server && node scripts/phrase-generator.js --range 1-100 --count 30 --language sv --theme cooking

# 2. üö® MANDATORY: Present phrases in table format to user for approval
# 3. üö® MANDATORY: Wait for explicit user approval 
# 4. ONLY AFTER APPROVAL: Import phrases
cd server && node scripts/phrase-importer.js --input data/phrases-sv-*.json --import
```

### Import Script
```bash
cd server
node scripts/phrase-importer.js --input data/phrases-*.json --import
```

### Preview Mode
```bash
# Generate without importing (safe preview)
node scripts/phrase-importer.js --input data/phrases-*.json --dry-run
```

## Quality Assurance

### Grammar Validation
- **üö® CRITICAL**: Swedish compound words must be single words (no s√§rskrivning!)
- Swedish grammar rules applied (see mandatory rules section above)
- 3-step AI correction process
- Language-specific patterns
- **MANDATORY**: Apply s√§rskrivning prevention rules to ALL Swedish phrases

### Theme Relevance
- Phrases must match requested theme
- Thematic consistency checked
- Contextual appropriateness verified

### Difficulty Accuracy
- Scoring algorithm applied consistently
- Distribution requirements enforced
- Range compliance verified

### Technical Validation
- Word length limits enforced
- Character restrictions applied
- JSON format validation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Wrong Working Directory
```bash
# Error: Command not found
# Solution: Check you're in the right directory
pwd  # Should show correct path
cd /Users/fredriksafsten/Workprojects/anagram-game  # For generation
cd /Users/fredriksafsten/Workprojects/anagram-game/server  # For import
```

#### Import Fails
```bash
# Error: File not found
# Solution: Check file path and permissions
ls -la server/data/phrases-*.json  # Verify files exist
```

#### Bad Difficulty Distribution
```bash
# Error: Clustering detected
# Solution: Regenerate with better distribution algorithm
# Check: No more than 50% in any single difficulty band
```

#### Staging Server Access
```bash
# Error: SSH connection failed
# Solution: Verify Pi server is accessible
ssh pi@192.168.1.222 "echo 'Connection OK'"
```
