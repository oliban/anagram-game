## 🚀 How to Get Started

### **1. Initialize GitFlow (One Command):**
```bash
./scripts/setup-gitflow.sh
```

### **2. Read the Workflow Guide:**
```bash
# Complete workflow explanation
cat docs/IMPROVED_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md

# See the benefits vs current approach
cat docs/WORKFLOW_COMPARISON.md
```

### **3. Test the New Workflow:**
```bash
# Create your first feature branch
git checkout develop && git pull && git checkout -b feature/test-new-workflow

# Make a small change and push (triggers quick tests)
echo "Testing GitFlow" > test.txt
git add test.txt && git commit -m "test: validate new workflow"
git push -u origin feature/test-new-workflow

# Create PR to develop (triggers comprehensive tests)
gh pr create --base develop --title "test: validate new workflow"
```

### **4. Run Test Suite:**
```bash
# Full automated test suite
node testing/scripts/automated-test-runner.js

# Quick validation
SKIP_PERFORMANCE=true node testing/scripts/automated-test-runner.js
```
