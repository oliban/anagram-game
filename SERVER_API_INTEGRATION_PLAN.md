## 🚨 CRITICAL: iOS App Migration Requirements
**BREAKING CHANGE**: Server migration to PostgreSQL introduces UUID-based players, incompatible with current iOS app

### **Phase 7: iOS App Database Migration (60-90 mins)**
- [ ] **7.1 Core Data Model Changes**
  - [ ] **Player Model**: Migrate from string IDs (`player_123_abc`) to UUIDs (`d2d3d95a-5a94-4cda-8b13-667e95388d84`)
  - [ ] **Phrase Model**: Add hint property and new response fields (difficultyLevel, phraseType, priority)
  - [ ] **Local Storage**: Update CoreData schemas and migration logic for existing user data

- [ ] **7.2 Network Layer Overhaul**
  - [ ] **API Integration**: Update all endpoints to handle UUID requests/responses
  - [ ] **Response Parsing**: Handle new phrase response format with hints and metadata
  - [ ] **Error Handling**: Support new HTTP status codes (503 for DB unavailable, proper UUID validation)
  - [ ] **WebSocket Events**: Update `player-connect` and `new-phrase` event handling for UUIDs and hints

- [ ] **7.3 UI/UX Enhancements**
  - [ ] **Hint Display**: Design and implement hint presentation UI (modal/inline/toggle)
  - [ ] **Error States**: Handle new error scenarios (database down, invalid player sessions)
  
- [ ] **7.4 Testing & Validation**
  - [ ] **Integration Testing**: End-to-end testing with new database-driven server
  - [ ] **Migration Testing**: Validate upgrade path from old to new app version
  - [ ] **Hint Functionality**: Comprehensive hint display and interaction testing
  - [ ] **WebSocket Testing**: Real-time hint delivery and player targeting validation

### **Phase 7 Risk Assessment:**
- **High Impact**: Complete rewrite of player identification system
- **Medium Risk**: Coordinated server/client deployment required
- **Data Safety**: Must preserve user progress and preferences during migration
- **User Experience**: Seamless transition essential for retention

## Implementation Order & Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path
