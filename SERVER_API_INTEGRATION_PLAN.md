## Implementation Order & Risk Mitigation

### Critical Path
1. **Database connection setup** (lowest risk)
2. **Player management migration** (medium risk - affects authentication)
3. **Basic phrase migration** (high risk - core game functionality)
4. **New hint endpoints** (low risk - additive features)
5. **Offline mode support** (low risk - new feature)

### Rollback Strategy
- Keep old PlayerStore/PhraseStore as fallback
- Environment variable to switch between old/new systems
- Database transaction rollback for failed operations
- Graceful degradation if database is unavailable

### Testing Checkpoints
1. **After Phase 1**: Database connectivity and health checks
2. **After Phase 2**: Player registration and socket management
3. **After Phase 3**: Basic phrase creation and retrieval with hints
4. **After Phase 4**: Full feature set including offline mode
5. **After Phase 5**: Client compatibility and performance testing

## Expected Timeline
- **Total time**: ~2 hours for complete migration
- **Critical functionality**: ~45 minutes (Phases 1-3)
- **New features**: ~45 minutes (Phases 4-5)
- **Polish & migration**: ~30 minutes (Phase 6)

## Deliverables
1. Fully migrated server with database persistence
2. All existing API endpoints maintained (backward compatible)
3. New hint-enabled endpoints for enhanced clients
4. Offline mode support for mobile clients
5. Comprehensive error handling and monitoring
6. Migration documentation and rollback procedures

## Notes
- This plan ensures zero downtime migration while adding the powerful new hint system and offline capabilities
- Maintains full backward compatibility with existing iOS client
- Adds foundation for offline mode and community phrase features
- Database foundation already complete and tested

- **Migration safety**: Comprehensive regression protection ‚úÖ

## Key Changes Made
- **Removed PlayerStore entirely** - Clean database-only implementation
- **Fixed all CLAUDE.md violations** - No fallbacks, migrations, or legacy comments
- **UUID-based players** - Database generates proper UUIDs instead of string IDs
- **Graceful error handling** - 503 errors when database unavailable, 404 for missing players
- **Comprehensive test infrastructure** - Production-ready testing framework

## Next: Phase 3
Ready to migrate phrase system from in-memory PhraseStore to DatabasePhrase with hints.
**Migration is safe** - comprehensive test suite provides excellent regression protection.
